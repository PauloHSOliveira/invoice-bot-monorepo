## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope
**Primary MVP**: Form Builder Architecture Foundation (US1) + Generic TypeScript Form Components (US2) + Zod Schema Integration (US3) + Firebase Abstraction Layer (US4) + Server Actions Pattern (US5) + Google OAuth Authentication (US6) + Email/Password Authentication (US7) + Authentication State Management (US9) + Toast Notifications and Error Handling (US11)

**Secondary MVP**: Phone Number Authentication (US8) + User Profile Management (US10) + Configuration-Driven Provider Strategy (US12) + Event-Based Analytics Integration (US13)

**Authentication Focus**: This implementation establishes the foundational authentication system for InvoiceBot MVP, providing secure user authentication with multiple methods (Google OAuth, Email/Password, Phone Number) and establishing architecture patterns that will be reused across all InvoiceBot features.

### Incremental Delivery
1. **Week 1**: ✅ Complete Phases 1-2 (Setup + Infrastructure) - **COMPLETED**
2. **Week 2**: Complete Phases 3-5 (Form Builder + Components + Zod)
3. **Week 3**: Complete Phases 6-7 (Firebase Abstraction + Server Actions)
4. **Week 4**: Complete Phases 8-9 (Google OAuth + Email/Password)
5. **Week 5**: Complete Phases 10-11 (Phone Auth + State Management)
6. **Week 6**: Complete Phases 12-13 (Profile Management + Toast Notifications)
7. **Week 7**: Complete Phases 14-16 (Configuration + Analytics + i18n)
8. **Week 8**: Complete Phases 17-20 (Documentation + Testing + Deployment)

### Independent Test Criteria

**US1 - Form Builder Architecture**: Form Builder components work independently and can be composed
**US2 - Generic TypeScript Components**: Form components are type-safe and reusable across different schemas
**US3 - Zod Schema Integration**: Schemas validate form data correctly and provide type safety
**US4 - Firebase Abstraction Layer**: Service interfaces work with Firebase and can be easily migrated
**US5 - Server Actions Pattern**: Server actions handle form submissions with proper error handling
**US6 - Google OAuth Authentication**: Users can authenticate with Google account and One Tap
**US7 - Email/Password Authentication**: Users can authenticate with email/password and reset passwords
**US8 - Phone Number Authentication**: Users can authenticate with phone number and SMS verification
**US9 - Authentication State Management**: Authentication state persists and syncs between server and client
**US10 - User Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile information
**US11 - Toast Notifications**: Error handling provides user feedback through toast notifications
**US12 - Configuration Strategy**: Authentication providers can be enabled/disabled via configuration
**US13 - Event-Based Analytics**: Authentication events are tracked for user behavior analysis
**US14 - Internationalization**: Authentication forms support multiple languages and locales
**US15 - Architecture Documentation**: All patterns are documented and enforced automatically
**US16 - Module-Based Testing**: All modules have comprehensive test coverage
