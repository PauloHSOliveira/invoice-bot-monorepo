# Implementation Plan: Authentication Methods

**Project:** InvoiceBot MVP  
**Feature:** Authentication Methods  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan establishes the foundational authentication system for InvoiceBot MVP, implementing Google OAuth (including Google One Tap), email/password, and phone number authentication. The plan establishes sophisticated architecture patterns (Form Builder, Server Actions, Firebase abstraction, modular organization) that will be reused across all InvoiceBot features, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive authentication system with three primary methods
- Foundational architecture patterns for InvoiceBot MVP
- Form Builder layout system with page-based structure
- Firebase abstraction layer for future API migration
- Modular organization with feature-based structure (@/modules/{feature}/{subfeature}/form)
- Generic TypeScript form components with React Hook Form integration
- Zod schema integration with useZodForm
- Event-based analytics with authentication tracking
- Toast notifications with server action error handling
- Configuration-driven provider strategy
- Module-based testing strategy
- Architecture documentation and enforcement mechanisms

## Constitution Check

This plan adheres to the following constitutional principles:
- ✅ User-Centric Design: Authentication system prioritizes user experience with multiple authentication options (Google OAuth, email/password, phone number) and seamless Google One Tap integration
- ✅ Scalable Architecture: Built using Firebase Authentication with abstraction layer for future API migration, following modular organization patterns (@/modules/{feature}/{subfeature}/form)
- ✅ Security First: Implements secure authentication flows with Firebase Auth tokens in HTTP-only cookies, server-side validation, and comprehensive input validation
- ✅ MVP Focus: Focuses on essential authentication methods for MVP launch, establishing foundational patterns for invoices, clients, templates, and scheduling features
- ✅ Quality Assurance: Includes comprehensive testing strategy (module-based testing, integration tests), Biome rules enforcement, and architecture documentation
