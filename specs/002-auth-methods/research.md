**Feature:** Authentication Methods  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

## Research Overview

This document consolidates research findings for implementing the Authentication Methods feature for InvoiceBot MVP, establishing foundational architecture patterns that will be reused across all InvoiceBot features.

## Research Areas & Findings

### 1. Firebase Authentication Best Practices

**Decision:** Use Firebase Authentication as primary authentication provider with abstraction layer

**Rationale:**
- Firebase Auth provides comprehensive authentication solutions with built-in security
- Supports multiple authentication methods (Google OAuth, Email/Password, Phone SMS)
- Handles user management, session management, and security automatically
- Provides SDKs for both client and server-side authentication
- Scales automatically with user growth
- Integrates seamlessly with other Firebase services

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Auth0: More expensive, complex setup for MVP
- Supabase Auth: Less mature ecosystem, limited third-party integrations
- Custom JWT implementation: High security risk, complex maintenance

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Implement abstraction layer for future API migration
- Store Firebase Auth tokens in HTTP-only cookies for security
- Use Firebase Auth state persistence for seamless user experience

### 2. Google One Tap Integration Patterns

**Decision:** Implement Google One Tap with strategic placement and toast notifications

**Rationale:**
- Google One Tap provides seamless authentication experience
- Reduces friction for returning users
- Shows toast notification when user is identified as logged in
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Google OAuth flow
- Respects user privacy preferences and can be dismissed

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Google Sign-In button only: Higher friction, requires user interaction
- Automatic sign-in: Privacy concerns, potential user confusion
- Popup-based OAuth: Poor mobile experience, security concerns

**Implementation Notes:**
- Place One Tap on login page for all users
- Optional global integration for returning authenticated users
- Implement toast notification system for user feedback
- Handle One Tap dismissal and error states gracefully
- Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility

### 3. Form Builder Architecture Patterns

**Decision:** Implement page-based Form Builder architecture with FormBuilderPage, FormBuilderWrapper, FormBuilderContent components

**Rationale:**
- Page-based structure provides clear form organization and navigation
- FormBuilderPage enables/disables form sections dynamically
- FormBuilderWrapper provides consistent form layout and styling
- FormBuilderContent manages form content and sections
- Supports complex multi-step forms with progress tracking
- Enables responsive design with FormBuilderRow maxColumns configuration

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single-page forms: Limited scalability, poor UX for complex forms
- Wizard-based forms: Complex state management, limited flexibility
- Dynamic form generation: Over-engineering for MVP needs

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use FormBuilderProvider for state management
- Implement useFormBuilderState and useFormBuilderDispatch hooks
- Support form progress tracking and page navigation
- Integrate with React Hook Form and Zod schemas
- Provide form field components (FormFieldInput, FormFieldRadioGroup, FormFieldInputMask)

### 4. Server Actions with Next.js App Router

**Decision:** Use Server Actions pattern with 'use server' functions for form handling

**Rationale:**
- Server Actions provide type-safe server-side form handling
- Eliminate need for API routes for form submissions
- Integrate seamlessly with Next.js App Router
- Provide built-in error handling and validation
- Support progressive enhancement and JavaScript-free operation
- Enable server-side analytics and logging

**Alternatives Considered:**
- API routes: More boilerplate, complex error handling
- Client-side form submission: Security concerns, complex state management
- GraphQL mutations: Over-engineering for MVP, complex setup

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implement 'use server' functions for authentication actions
- Use ServerActionResult types for type-safe responses
- Integrate with analytics for authentication event tracking
- Handle errors gracefully with proper error propagation
- Support form validation and sanitization

### 5. Firebase Abstraction Layer Patterns

**Decision:** Implement service abstraction interfaces for future API migration

**Rationale:**
- Abstraction layer enables future migration from Firebase to dedicated API
- Provides consistent interface for all backend services
- Enables easy testing with mock implementations
- Supports gradual migration without breaking changes
- Maintains type safety across service boundaries

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Direct Firebase SDK usage: Tight coupling, difficult migration
- Custom API from start: Over-engineering for MVP, longer development time
- Microservices architecture: Complex for MVP, unnecessary overhead

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create service interfaces in packages/shared directory
- Implement Firebase-specific service implementations
- Use factory pattern for service creation
- Support environment-based configuration
- Provide error handling abstraction

### 6. Modular Organization Patterns

**Decision:** Use @/modules/{feature}/{subfeature}/form structure with consistent patterns

**Rationale:**
- Modular organization provides clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based structure enables independent development
- Consistent patterns across all features improve maintainability
- Supports code reuse and shared components
- Enables easy testing and debugging

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Monolithic structure: Poor scalability, difficult maintenance
- Component-based organization: Limited feature separation
- Domain-driven design: Over-engineering for MVP

**Implementation Notes:**
- Organize modules by feature (auth, invoices, clients, templates)
- Use consistent subdirectory structure (form/, actions/, types/, constants/)
- Implement module-level exports with proper index.tsx files
- Separate shared modules from feature-specific modules
- Use TypeScript for type-safe module imports and exports

### 7. Generic TypeScript Form Components Patterns

**Decision:** Implement generic TypeScript form components with Control<T> and FieldPath<T> typing

**Rationale:**
- Generic typing provides type safety across different form schemas
- Control<T> and FieldPath<T> enable proper React Hook Form integration
- Reusable components reduce code duplication
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Supports composition with optional components

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Any-typed components: No type safety, runtime errors
- Specific form components: Code duplication, maintenance overhead
- Form libraries: Limited customization, vendor lock-in

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Control<T> for form control typing
- Use FieldPath<T> for field name typing
- Implement BaseFormInputProps<T> for common properties
- Support validation rules and error handling
- Provide accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### 8. Zod Schema Integration with React Hook Form

**Decision:** Use centralized Zod schemas with useZodForm hook integration

**Rationale:**
- Zod provides runtime type validation and TypeScript integration
- Centralized schemas ensure consistency across forms
- useZodForm hook simplifies integration with React Hook Form
- Schema-based error message generation
- Type-safe form data handling with schema inference

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Manual validation: Error-prone, inconsistent
- Yup schemas: Less TypeScript integration
- Form validation libraries: Limited customization, vendor lock-in

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create centralized Zod schemas for all authentication forms
- Implement useZodForm hook with zodResolver
- Use schema inference for type-safe form data
- Support custom validation rules and error messages
- Integrate with React Hook Form for seamless validation

### 9. Event-Based Analytics Patterns

- Support error handling and validation

### 10. Toast Notifications with Server Action Error Handling

**Decision:** Implement toast notifications with server action error handling

**Rationale:**
- Toast notifications provide immediate user feedback
