- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Review**: Task completed and awaiting review
- **Testing**: Task in testing phase
- **Done**: Task completed and verified

### Status Transitions
```
Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Testing → Done
   ↑         ↑         ↑          ↑         ↑
   └─────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────┘
   (Can be moved back based on review results)
